# py_grama
Implementation of the *grammar of model analysis* (*grama*).

# Installation
Clone this repo and add to your `PYTHONPATH`. Note that I also use a fork of `dfply` for many of the examples; suggest cloning and adding [dfply](https://github.com/zdelrosario/dfply) as well. (Note that I'm considering making this `dfply` fork a formal dependency.)

# Quick Tour
For a quick overview of `py_grama`, see the [demo](https://github.com/zdelrosario/py_grama/blob/master/examples/demo/grama_demo.ipynb).
